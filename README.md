This repository corresponds to the scripts used to perform the experimental evaluations of TREE-QMC.

The TREE-QMC method, which estimates a species tree from binary gene trees, was introduced in this paper:

* Han and Molloy, 2023, Improving quartet graph construction for scalable and accurate species tree estimation from gene trees, *Genome Research* 33: 1042-1052. [doi:10.1101/gr.277629.122](http://doi.org/10.1101/gr.277629.122)

A version of the TREE-QMC method, which estimates a species tree from binary characters, was introduced in this paper:

* Han and Molloy, Quartets enable statistically consistent estimation of cell lineage trees under an unbiased error and missingness model, *Invited to Algorithms for Molecular Biology (Special issue for WABI 2023)*.
